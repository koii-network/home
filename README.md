## Using this repo
This repo deploys to openkoi.com via Github Pages whenever a new commit is made to the 'main' branch. 

To run the repo locally, you can install ruby and jekyll (https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) and then run 
```bundle install
bundle exec jekyll server
```

This will run a server on port 4000 in your localhost, and will refresh whenever you save changes to a new file.

VSCode also supports several extensions which can streamline things significantly.
