This repo deploys to koii.network.com via Github Pages whenever a new commit is made to the 'main' branch.

To run the repo locally, you can install ruby and jekyll (https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) and then run

```

This will run a server on port 4000 in your localhost, and will refresh whenever you save changes to a new file.

VSCode also supports several extensions which can streamline things significantly.
