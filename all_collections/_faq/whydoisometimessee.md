title: Why do I sometimes see references to goldfish?
describe: <b>Koi nodes are like goldfish, because they do not have a very long memory.</b> Instead, we store things permanently on Arweave.<br><br>Koi and goldfish are both part of the carp family, and in the very first iterations of this project were called goldfish. We lovingly refer to our gold and red mascot as a goldfish and sometimes compare the power of giant schools of goldfish to the power of the Koi network in homage to our roots.
