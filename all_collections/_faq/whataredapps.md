title: What are dApps?
describe: A dApp (shorthand for “decentralized application”) is just like any other website, except the users collectively own all the data. Most websites are hosted centrally, which means that all the data processed by that site is stored in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_farm" target="_blank">server farm</a> owned by the company. In Koi’s model, the network (and therefore, all the data) is owned by all the Node Agents who run Koi on their personal computers. Being decentralized means that no single entity decides what happens to that data.
