title: Can anybody run a node?
describe: Yes! We will soon be coming out with a node that is easy to use and interact with for anyone. The first version of the node uses the Command Line Interface (CLI), which can be challenging to navigate if you are not a developer. That said, when it launches, we will have a step-by-step tutorial so anyone can learn how.
