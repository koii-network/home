describe: Right now, you can visit the <a href="https://koi.rocks/faucet" target="_blank">KOI Faucet</a> to get some free KOI. Then you should register an NFT (or make one) on <a href="https://koi.rocks"  target="_blank"> koi.rocks</a> so you can start earning KOI through attention rewards!<br>Very soon, you will be able to run a Koi node and earn by renting a very small amount of space on your computer to help keep the network running. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSduDTdxD3dDOvcbIcKlG7JWOsnDFVZFdLy0J38q_OOzUC3okA/viewform"  target="_blank">Pre-register now!</a>
