          <h1>Koii is a framework for the new Internet</h1>
          <p>The Narcissus Flower is the premier unveiling of the  Dynamic NFT standard, which creates an <span>Internet made for and by the people</span>. It rewards people for using the Internet. </p>
          <p>When people get rewarded, it creates an Internet that is <span>more rewarding for everyone</span>, where data is owned by its creator and all creators are paid for their work. </p>
          <p>Dynamic NFTs are one example of the Atomic NFT standard, <span>the fundamental building block of the fair, community-owned Internet.</span></p>
