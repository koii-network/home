                    When people have access to resources, they can create, innovate, and change the world. This kind of transformation should be available to more than just those who can afford to pay for it, unfairly skewing progress towards the wealthy.

                                Koii was founded on fairness, trust, and one immense objective: to give creators a space where they permanently own and earn the value they deserve from their content.

                                This lack of access to resources is amplified in the creator space too. When you take a beautiful photo and it goes viral on social media, the platform makes money off your work, not youâ€” and they own it, too. 
                                Artists and other creators are exploited because they love what they do. You should earn the rewards for all your hard work and creativity.
