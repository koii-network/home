                    <h3>4. Stake more, earn more</h3>
                    <p>You get to choose how many tokens to stake on each Koii Task your node runs. The more you stake, the more you earn.</p>
                    <p>After a Task is complete, the Taskâ€™s bounty is rewarded to participating nodes, proportional to the amount of staked tokens. If you staked 20% of all tokens staked, you will receive 20% of the bounty.</p>
                    <p>This means it is better to stake many tokens on a small number of Tasks than a few tokens each on hundreds of Tasks.</p>
